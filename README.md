# Unimaster


## Executive Summary
During the EIT Summer School in Bratislava, our team developed UniMaster, a unified platform aimed at simplifying and streamlining the university admission process for both students and institutions. Despite initial challenges, we identified key issues in the education system, particularly regarding complex administrative procedures and lack of transparency. UniMaster addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform for students to submit their documents once and apply to multiple programs, while also allowing universities to efficiently manage applications and reach out to potential students.

## Problem and Solution
The traditional university admission process involves repetitive document submissions, lengthy validation periods, and lack of transparency. UniMaster solves these issues by enabling students to create a profile with verified documents, applying to multiple programs with ease. Universities benefit from streamlined processes and increased visibility to potential students.

## Business Modeling and Planning
Our long-term vision is to become the leading solution for managing university applications globally. Initially, we focus on American students applying to European universities due to the high demand for such services. We plan to generate revenue through flat fees and success fees from students, while exploring partnerships with universities for additional revenue streams.

## Business Development Process
Through interviews and research, we validated the need for UniMaster and iteratively developed the solution based on feedback and market insights. Each team member contributed to different aspects of the project, from research and validation to business modeling and planning.

## Self Evaluation
The summer school provided valuable lessons in team organization, realistic business planning, and stepping out of comfort zones. We learned the importance of understanding each team member's skills and perspectives, staying grounded in business development, and embracing challenges for personal and professional growth.

## Outcome
Our project won second place at the EIT Summer School, reflecting the potential impact UniMaster could have had on simplifying university admissions and fostering international education opportunities. With continued development and strategic partnerships, UniMaster aimed to revolutionize the university application process and promote global education accessibility.
